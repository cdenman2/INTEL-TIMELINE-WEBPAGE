                Intel introduces a few products including the Intel Atom PS900, the Intel 3rd Gen Xeon Scalable, and the 10nm-based 11th Gen Intel Core. Intel Atom PS900 Microprocessor that was primarily built for low power consumption and embedding file applications on netbooks. The Intel 3rd Gen Xeon Scalable Microprocessor could achieve 80 cores and was built for high workloads and performance with power efficiency. The Intel 11th Gen Intel Core was built for high resolution with graphics. All three processors are still being used to this day and not discontinued. Another fact is that Intel was at the frontlines of AI and 5g Production.
